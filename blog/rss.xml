            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! This is the very first blog post of The Nest.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about setting up a personal website so that I can access my notes from anywhere. I love my note taking apps but sometimes it&#x27;s annoying that I only have my valuable stuff on my working computer. Besides, my partner and I wanted to start keeping docs on somewhere other than Google Drive, both as motivation to learn more stuff and keep record of our progress.</p><p>Anyway, this website is probably going to contain random posts and notes for all kinds of stuff. I&#x27;ll mainly work on cybersecurity and things I recently encountered on work, while Steven might be documenting some of his own studies. We hope to also continue our language learning endeavors. And probably some travel blogs or rambles.</p><p>That&#x27;s it for now!</p>]]></content:encoded>

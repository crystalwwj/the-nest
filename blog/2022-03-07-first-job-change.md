Recently, I've decided to quit my current job and join another renowned cybersecurity company. It wasn't exactly planned as I was only curious about what the position, the company, and the people there were like. I wasn't some sort of disgruntled employee looking for new opportunities. Well, I *was* looking at the opportunity, of course, but rather than being pushed forward by some grudge I was more interested in exploring the landscape of the cybersecurity industry. I'm still rather fresh to the field with merely three years of exposure, if you count undergrad courses and projects, and still have so much ahead to discover. 

I'm not a naturally curious person. Well, maybe I'm interested in learning about lots of stuff, but that's just 'whoa cool, how does it work' level of interest, not 'I love this gonna deep dive' level of passion. To be honest with myself, I don't think I ever had a passion. When I do things it mostly started off a whiz, and then I try to stick to it because I don't like the feeling of giving up. Unless I hate it already, I try to do my best and get the most out of it. So most things I do for a while or do well, it's probably out of perserverence rather than passion. And that's the worst thing about me. I can't seem to find something that hits different, that rings a bell in my ears like how fate calls upon the destined. I've been searching and trying out stuff, but nothing ever worked out. Finally I settled on what my father told me: something that I might not love but will always have some fun in. That's how cybersecurity came along. Something I won't call my passion but is cool enough to retain my interest.

So, yeah. The job switch came unexpected. To my family, to my colleagues, and to me, too.

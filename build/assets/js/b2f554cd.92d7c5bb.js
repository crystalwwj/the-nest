This is the very first blog post of The Nest.\\n\\nI\'ve been thinking about setting up a personal website so that I can access my notes from anywhere. I love my note taking apps but sometimes it\'s annoying that I only have my valuable stuff on my working computer. Besides, my partner and I wanted to start keeping docs on somewhere other than Google Drive, both as motivation to learn more stuff and keep record of our progress.\\n\\nAnyway, this website is probably going to contain random posts and notes for all kinds of stuff. I\'ll mainly work on cybersecurity and things I recently encountered on work, while Steven might be documenting some of his own studies. We hope to also continue our language learning endeavors.

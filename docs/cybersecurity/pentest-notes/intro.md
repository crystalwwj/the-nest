# Intro

When prepping for the OSCP, I took notes on all the boxes and pitfalls I encountered. I tried to keep them as structured and easily accessible as I could within the limited time I had, but still, it was makeshift and messy...

This is why I'm trying to review and migrate my Bear and CherryTree notes here. Hopefully they're more organized now.

Estimated structure:

* Foothold
    * host discovery and service enumeration
    * connecting and using common services
    * web 
    * samba, LDAP
    * NFS, SNMP
* Privesc
    * Linux
    * Windows
* Reverse shells and msfvenom
* Password cracking
* Exploits: searching and compiling
* File transfer
* Tunneling / port forwarding
* Useful commands and tips

Everything WIP hahaha
